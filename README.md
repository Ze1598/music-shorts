# YouTube Shorts Generator

## Overview

This application automates the creation of YouTube Shorts videos with integrated YouTube upload and scheduling capabilities. It takes a square input image and an audio file, and generates a 9:16 aspect ratio video (defaulting to 60 FPS). The video features the input image centered with rounded corners, and its shadow also has rounded corners for a cohesive look. Users can choose between a solid background color (derived from the image's predominant color) or a blurred version of the input image as the background.

A key feature is an optional, highly customizable audio-reactive waveform animation displayed below the centered image, with configurable vertical spacing between the image and the waveform. The application now includes full YouTube integration for direct upload and advanced scheduling of videos.

All key aspects like input file paths, audio timings, image placement, visual effects, output filename, and YouTube publishing settings are configurable through an intuitive web interface.

## Features

### üé¨ Video Generation
-   **Input Image**: Uses a user-provided square image (PNG or JPG).
-   **Rounded Corners**: Both the centered image and its shadow are processed to have rounded corners. Radius is configurable.
-   **Selectable Background Mode**: `"solid"` (predominant color) or `"blur_image"`. Blur intensity and image fit (`"stretch"`, `"crop"`, `"fill"`) are configurable.
-   **Unified Shadow Effect**: The centered image and its waveform (if enabled) receive a shadow using the same offset, blur, and color derivation logic.
-   **Video Profiles System**: Pre-configured settings profiles for different video types:
    *   **Shorts with waveform**: 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920) optimized for YouTube Shorts
    *   **Visualizer with waveform**: 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080) for landscape music visualizations
    *   **Custom profiles**: Easily extensible through `video_profiles.yaml` configuration
-   **Smart Audio Duration Management**: 
    *   **Auto-calculate video length**: Automatically sets video duration to match audio file length
    *   **Editable time controls**: Start/end times remain fully editable even with auto-calculation enabled
    *   **Persistent values**: Manual adjustments are preserved when toggling between auto/manual modes
-   **Advanced Audio-Reactive Waveform Animation**:
    *   **Enabled/Disabled**: Can be turned on or off.
    *   **Analysis Modes**: `"rms"` (overall intensity) or `"melspectrogram"` (dynamic frequency band reaction).
    *   **Advanced Color Modes**: For waveform bars:
        *   `"custom"`: Uses `WAVEFORM_COLOR` RGB tuple.
        *   `"contrast"`: Automatically selects a legible contrasting color (attempts inverted, then complementary-like, then black/white) against the background area behind the waveform or the predominant image color.
        *   `"white"`: Forces waveform to be white.
        *   `"black"`: Forces waveform to be black.
    *   **Shadow**: Waveform bars have a shadow, using shared parameters.
    *   **Customizable Appearance**: Waveform height, bar count (`n_mels` for melspectrogram), bar spacing, smoothing, and vertical spacing from the main image (`SPACING_IMAGE_WAVEFORM`) are configurable.

## YouTube Integration Setup

### Required Google Cloud Setup

To use the YouTube upload and scheduling features, you need to set up Google OAuth credentials:

#### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**:
   - Go to APIs & Services ‚Üí Library
   - Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
   - Click "Enable"

#### 2. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. Go to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen if prompted
4. Choose "Web application" as application type
5. Add these **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   - `http://localhost:8501` (for local development)
   - `https://your-app-url.streamlit.app/` (for deployed version)
6. Download the credentials JSON file

#### 3. Required OAuth Scopes
The application requires the following Google OAuth scope:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube` - Full access to YouTube account for uploading and managing videos

**Note**: This scope requires Google verification if you plan to make the app available to other users. For personal use, you can run in testing mode.

#### 4. YouTube Channel Requirements
- You must have a YouTube channel associated with your Google account
- The channel must be in good standing (no strikes or restrictions)
- For scheduled uploads, videos must be set to "private" privacy status (YouTube API requirement)

### Credentials Configuration

The app supports two methods for providing OAuth credentials:

#### Local Development (Recommended)
1. Download your OAuth credentials JSON from Google Cloud Console
2. Rename it to `client_secrets.json` 
3. Place it in the project root directory
4. The app will automatically use this file

#### Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Cloud, etc.)
Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Your OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your OAuth client secret
- `STREAMLIT_APP_URL` - Your app's URL (e.g., `https://your-app.streamlit.app`)

The app automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate method.

### Authentication Flow
1. Click "Get Authorization Code" in the YouTube tab
2. You'll be redirected to Google for authorization
3. After granting permissions, you'll be redirected back to the app
4. Authentication completes automatically - no manual code copying required!

## Video Profiles

The application now includes a flexible video profiles system via `video_profiles.yaml`:

### Available Profiles

1. **Shorts with waveform** (default):
   - 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920)
   - 65% image width
   - Optimized for YouTube Shorts format

2. **Visualizer with waveform**:
   - 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080) 
   - 25% image width (smaller, more focus on waveform)
   - Ideal for landscape music visualizations

### Profile Configuration

All profiles are defined in `video_profiles.yaml` with the following structure:
- **Input/Output**: Audio timing, output filename, auto-duration settings
- **Video**: Dimensions, FPS, aspect ratio
- **Background**: Mode (blur/solid), blur radius, image fit options
- **Image**: Size, positioning, corner radius
- **Shadow**: Offsets, blur radius, darkness
- **Waveform**: All animation parameters, colors, spacing

### Adding Custom Profiles

Simply extend `video_profiles.yaml` with new profile definitions. Each profile requires a `display_name` attribute for the UI dropdown.

## Parameters

All parameters can be configured through the Streamlit interface, with profile-based defaults or manual customization:

-   **Video Profiles**: Choose from pre-configured settings or customize any parameter
-   **Auto-Duration**: Automatically set video length to match audio file duration
-   **Real-time Editing**: All fields remain editable regardless of profile selection

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: All video generation happens locally on your machine
- **No Data Storage**: The app doesn't store your media files or personal data
- **Temporary Files**: Uploaded files are temporarily stored during processing and cleaned up afterward

### YouTube Integration Security
- **OAuth 2.0**: Uses industry-standard Google OAuth for secure authentication
- **Limited Scope**: Only requests YouTube upload permissions, no access to other Google services
- **Credential Storage**: 
  - Local: Credentials stored in browser session only
  - Cloud: Environment variables stored securely by hosting platform
- **No Persistent Storage**: Authentication tokens are not permanently stored

### Recommended Security Practices
- Use a dedicated Google account for API access if sharing the app
- Regularly review authorized apps in your Google account settings
- Keep your `client_secrets.json` file secure and never commit it to version control
- For production deployments, consider implementing additional access controls
